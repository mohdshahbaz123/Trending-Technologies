# Robotic Process Automation
Robotic process automation (RPA), also known as software robotics, uses intelligent automation technologies to perform repetitive office tasks of human workers.

> Robotic process automation (RPA), also known as software robotics, uses automation technologies to mimic back-office tasks of human workers, such as extracting data, filling in forms, moving files, et cetera. It combines APIs and user interface (UI) interactions to integrate and perform repetitive tasks between enterprise and productivity applications. By deploying scripts which emulate human processes, RPA tools complete autonomous execution of various activities and transactions across unrelated software systems.

- This form of automation uses rule-based software to perform business process activities at a high-volume, freeing up human resources to prioritize more complex tasks. RPA enables CIOs and other decision makers to accelerate their digital transformation efforts and generate a higher return on investment (ROI) from their employee, allowing its digital workforce via RPA to shoulder more tedious and time-consuming tasks.

- However, prior to adopting RPA technologies, organizations should evaluate their readiness to adopt by examining their data management processes and data architecture. RPA is dependent on high-quality data and strong data governance to be successful, and if the right guardrails (e.g. center of excellence, governance boards, documented guidelines) are not in place, it will not be able to meet the expectations of the business.
